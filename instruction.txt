Step 1: Setting Up Your Resume Builder Project
- Create a new project directory for your Resume Builder app.
- Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init.
- Install Express using npm install express.

Step 2: Create Project Structure
- Create directories for Views and Controllers.
- For example: views and controllers.

Step 3: Set Up Express
- Create an app.js file.
- Set up Express in app.js.
- Configure static file serving for CSS and JavaScript.
- Listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000).

Step 4: Create Form and Resume Views
- Inside the views directory, create two HTML templates: one for the form and one for displaying the resume.
- The form view should contain a form where users can input their resume information.
- The resume view should be initially empty and will be dynamically rendered with data from the form.

Step 5: Create Form Handling Controller
- In the controllers directory, create a controller file (e.g., resumeController.js).
- Define a route handler that serves the form view when a user accesses the root URL (e.g., /).
- Define a POST route handler that processes form submissions.
- In the POST route handler, retrieve form data from req.body and dynamically generate the resume based on this data.
- Render the resume view with the dynamically generated resume content.

Step 6: Configure the Form
- In the form view, set up an HTML form with fields for resume information (e.g., name, contact, skills, experience).
- Use HTML form elements like <input>, <textarea>, and <select> to collect user data.

Expected Result:
- By following these steps, your Resume Builder app will allow users to input their resume details through a form. After submitting the form, the app will dynamically render a resume page based on the user's input, which can be viewed and saved. This provides a simple but functional foundation for a resume-building web application using Node.js and Express.
